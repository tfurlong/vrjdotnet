---------- ------------ -------------------------------------------------------
2003-11-23 patrickh     Fully synchronized with RELENG_1_5.
                        NEW VERSION: 1.99.14
2003-11-23 patrickh     Added support for generating Python code from IDL.
2003-11-23 patrickh     Added a "warning level" feature for compiling with
                        different degrees of strictness.
2003-06-10 patrickh     Changed the command-line arguments --with-awroot,
                        --with-paroot, --with-synroot, and --with-glutroot to
                        --with-audioworks, --with-portaudio, --with-subsynth,
                        and --with-glut respectively.
                        NEW VERSION: 1.99.12
2003-05-23 patrickh     Merged the compiler warning level features from
                        RELENG_1_5.
                        NEW VERSION: 1.99.11
2003-01-25 patrickh     Changed the command-line arguments --with-oglroot and
                        --with-oalroot to --with-opengl and --with-openal
                        respectively.
                        NEW VERSION: 1.99.10
2002-12-02 patrickh     Added macros for determining which linker to use and if
                        that linker is GNU ld.
                        NEW VERSION: 1.99.9
2002-12-02 patrickh     Swapped the order of the first two arguments to
                        DPP_HAVE_CPPUNIT.
                        Added the new macro DPP_CHECK_DYNLAOD_LIB.
                        NEW VERSION: 1.99.8
2002-11-27 patrickh     Rewrote the CppUnit detection macro.  The command-line
                        argument it adds has been changed to --with-cppunit.
                        It now takes another argument specifying the minimum
                        required version.
2002-11-17 patrickh     Resynchronized with RELENG_1_5 as of today.
                        NEW VERSION: 1.99.7
2002-09-18 nonchocoboy  Renamed dos2unix and unix2dos to unixpath and dospath
                        respectively.
                        NEW VERSION: 1.99.6
2002-08-16 patrickh     Removed the empty macro DPP_SYSTEM_SETUP().
                        NEW VERSION: 1.99.5
2002-08-16 patrickh     Separated compiler-sepcific setup from system-specific
                        setup.  There is now a macro called DPP_COMPILER_SETUP
                        that handles the compiler-specific configuration.  It
                        is called automaticaly by DPP_PROG_CC and DPP_PROG_CXX.
                        NEW VERSION: 1.99.4
2002-07-31 patrickh     Revamped DPP_PERL_VER to work better and to deal with
                        the version numbering change between Perl 5.005 and
                        5.6.0.
                        NEW VERSION: 1.99.3
2002-05-28 patrickh     Added a version check to DPP_HAVE_BOOST().  The minimum
                        version number is the first argument.  All the other
                        arguments have been "shifted over" one position.  This
                        was merged from the 1.5 release branch.
                        NEW VERSION: 1.99.2
2002-04-06 patrickh     Improved support for forcing the use of GCC for
                        compiling.
                        NEW VERSION: 1.99.1
2002-04-03 patrickh     Moved package-detection macros into pkgs, a new
                        subdirectory of config.
                        NEW VERSION: 1.99.0
2002-12-14 patrickh     Added the ability to specify the path to the NSPR
                        headers in the DPP_HAVE_NSPR macro through the use of
                        a new command line option (--with-nspr-includes).  Part
                        of this change included a modifcation to the argument
                        list of DPP_NSPR_VER.
                        NEW VERSION: 1.4.101
2002-01-13 subatomic    Added tests for CppUnit and Boost.
2002-01-02 patrickh     Added dpp.simple-app.mk, a backend makefile stub for
                        compiling a single application from a (potentially
                        complex) source base.
2002-01-02 patrickh     Fixed DPP_VERSION_COMPARE for all platforms.  ksh(1) is
                        no longer required at all on Solaris.
                        NEW VERSION: 1.4.99
2001-12-19 patrickh     Initial support for building profiled libraries in
                        addition to debugging and optimized versions.
                        NEW VERSION: 1.4.98
2001-12-10 patrickh     Fixed a major bug in DPP_VERSION_COMPARE that prevented
                        it from ever working correctly.
                        NEW VERSION: 1.4.97
2001-12-06 patrickh     Changed the search order for the macro DPP_PATH_JAVA.
                        The new order gives preference to the
                        command-line-specified path which makes sense.
2001-11-18 patrickh     Added -DPIC to the C and C++ compiler's dynamic library
                        command-line arguments.
2001-11-15 patrickh     Added recognition of a new variable to dpp.install.mk
                        that allows users to list subdirectories for recursion
                        where only installation will occur.
2001-11-13 patrickh     Version number changed to 1.4.95 after the addition of
                        DPP_JDK_VERSION.
2001-11-10 patrickh     Generalized the IDL support.
2001-10-12 patrickh     Increased version to 1.4.94 after successful testing
                        with Autoconf 2.52 and Automake 1.5.  ace.m4 and
                        nspr.m4 had circular dependencies that Autoconf 2.5x
                        does not allow.
2001-09-06 patrickh     The targets for building shared libraries (DLLs) have
                        been renamed to avoid confusion.
