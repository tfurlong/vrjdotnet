VRJ.NET is a collection of C/C++ libraries and .NET assemblies that provide bindings to the Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) for VR Juggler. In other words, VRJ.NET offers .NET 1.1 bindings for VR Juggler. Using VRJ.NET, VR Juggler application objects can be written in any .NET language (those conforming to the Common Language Specification) including C# and VB.NET. These application objects are loaded into the standard VR Juggler kernel and handled just as though they were natively compiled C++ objects.
